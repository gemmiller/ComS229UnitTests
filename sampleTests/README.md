###Sample project

This is an example how a project might be tested using gtest
I will continue to try to improve it over time

### Running the tests

There are 2 ways to run the tests

The first is to run:

```
	$ make test
```

This will run the tests output them to standard out clean up the executable

The second way is to generate the executable and run it:

```
	$ make
	$ ./sampleTests
```

If you do it this way you will have to clean up the executable on your own
